At last it’s officially spring, the last few years have taught me not to jinx summer by predicting a good one so I’m just going to say that if it turns out to be anything like the winter we’ve had up here, it would be glorious. Who knows what’s coming weatherwise but new season has landed in the shops and it’s time to look at the Spring fashion trends 2025. There were a lot of different looks on the catwalks for SS25, it almost felt as if designers were throwing anything and everything out there to see what might stick. The stage of the fashion cycle that I’ve always found most interesting though is when retailers sit down and analyse what they’ve seen. I always loved watching the debates between the trend-focused buyers and the sales-focused merchandisers as they argued about what would make the shop floor and window displays look exciting versus what would actually sell. I spent the second half of last week in London assessing the outcome. As always I narrowed my gaze to look past the high trends that are bought in shallow numbers to inspire fashionista headlines until I found the wardrobe refreshes that will work hard in real life. So let me talk you through the Spring fashion trends 2025 – the most wearable looks you’ll find on the high street.
But first, there’s always a question in a wiser, more experienced woman’s mind that asks, “do I care about trends?” And it’s valid, especially in a time of global uncertainty when everybody instinctively girds their loins by tightening their budgets and there isn’t much appetite for frippery. By midlife most of us have worked out what we like to wear and which styles suit us best but it doesn’t mean we should completely ignore trends.
Fashion is a social currency, it’s a signal that runs through the street, the human equivalent of dogs weeing on a lamppost. There is no clearer illustration of the zeitgeist than the choices we make when we’re cloaking our bodies and the mood behind the trends depicts the way a nation is feeling. So, a bit like being on top of current affairs, it’s an important piece of social communication.
Sartorial reference to current trends says, “I’m still engaged” versus “I’ve checked out”. Or it can be used to say, “I’m different/I disagree” – some people deliberately ignore trends. Think of goths or punks or today’s indies using their style toindicate that they don’t subscribe to mainstream society, that they run with a different tribe. What you wear is visual signalling of who you are, how you feel about yourself and the world at large, it’s up to you to choose what you want to convey.
Like most things human when you break the trends down they can all seem a bit daft, my job here though is to interpret fashion from a midlife perspective. At an individual level I see small nods to trend in an outfit that is otherwise based around what you know works for you as a cut-through for retaining visibility and being seen as a player. Just a clever social reference here and there shows that you’re still taking part in life’s game but… on your own terms. So I guess you need to decide on whether you want to look as if you’re still playing – you don’t have to, it might be that you’re ready to sit on the sides and watch.
That’s a big choice to make though – style is subliminal social interchange and a midlifer whostill has her finger on the pulse stands out. It’s uplifting to see an older woman interpreting fashion rather than following it slavishly – I think we all give her a metaphorical high five. So today, rather than giving you a complete rundown of SS25 in all its glory I’m going to pull out the wearable trends and chat through them. This post is here to help you to tweak your wardrobe, to give you ideas of how you can keep looking relevant and engaged with minimal effort and outlay.
Before I move onto the most wearable trends though let’s just sweep over some of the other looks that you’ll see in the shops – there’s a return to skirts worn over trousers… remember that in the 90s? I always hated it but it’s there if you like it – there are hybrid pieces around in the shops with trousers that have a skirt-like apron over the front and quite a few skorts around for the hot weather too.

Transparency is bigger than it was last year – there’s plenty of voile and tulle that is designed to be worn with big pants and no bra – it leaves nothing to the imagination but you do you. Or you can even forget the big pants!

The 90s power suit is back – a slight move on from last year’s revival of the sharp tailoring of the 80s although they’re still around too thanks to Rivals. It has oversized, soft blazers with full pleated trousers – very elegant if you have the lifestyle for it.

Double breasted trouser suit
Hotpants are this year’s mini-skirt, worn super short with cropped tops. And there’s a return to 90s plaid for summer which is a weave that’s always made me grit my teeth, it feels like a poor man’s tartan to me – this look is current at Zara, the very worst of the 90s in my opinion.

There are two very strong options that are easy to weave into your wardrobe though so let’s move on to those.
For those of us who’ve been through more than a few new seasons, it probably feels as though the Boho trend epitomised by Sienna Miller in the noughties was only yesterday. We remember it so clearly because it was probably the first big look that came as a response to the need for standout on the newly emerging social media channels. Early adopters on there scrambled to have a ‘look,’ defined through the daily posting of outfits that had more drama than the everyday – and Boho caught fire like dry kindling.

But that version of Boho was just a rehash of the original which appeared in the 1960s as a rejection of the formality of the old world. And when you put it into the context of the times we’re living through it makes sense that the same kind of values rejection is being manifested again through fashion. Boho is a repudiation of the stealth wealth display that we’ve seen around us over the last few years, epitomised of course by the wardrobes of the women in the Trump family. Fashion is, as always, being used as semaphore.
This time around it’s slightly different to the early noughties version, it isn’t as loose and it plays more with texture. I’m sure you can’t have missed the amount of tan suede that’s around and it’s key to the look which is great because it’s a very wearable way of adding a touch of Boho to the outfits you already have. The problem is that the jackets are such a big trend that they’ve sold out almost everywhere already, this is probably thebest selection of suede and leather jacketsin stock.
I’ve found this one in the sale and it’s still available in all sizes

Suede sale jacket
This is in menswear but it could be worth sizing down to a small

Suede bomber jacket
And this is perfect if you have the budget for it. I can say that you do get great cost per wear out of a tan suede jacket – I’ve had mine since 2014 and regardless of trend it’s always one of my first choices for cooler spring/summer/early autumn days because the soft colour and finish work so well with lighter fabrics.

Luxury suede jacket
Alternatively you could add a tan suede bag, you’ll probably be surprised by how quickly it becomes your first choice for spring and summer because it works with everything.

So a suede jacket and/or bag is the easiest way of adding a touch of Boho to your everyday.
The full Boho look is very frothy as you can see in the display here…

… and you’ll find this frothiness everywhere this season. Brands have used it to encompass a more wearable version of transparency and they’ve married it with the trend for floral chintz. Floral chintz (also known as grandma’s sofa) is going to be even bigger for AW25.

Teamed with frothiness it’s everywhere for both casualwear…

… and for formalwear…

…. it’s going to be key for graduations, weddings, races.

I’d caution any midlifer to be very careful with it – you’re just a fondant fancy away from the Queen Mother in this kind of look but then I would say that – I’m not a lover of any kind of frill. The thing you’ll notice when you look at all of these dresses is that they’re waisted – the loose Boho buffet dress is nowhere to be seen, it’s one of the pieces that will date your look the fastest this summer. All you have to do is decide whether you care – you can always choose to rock your own style.
There’s one more easy way to add the new Boho to your wardrobe though and that’s with a lace trim blouse in cream or white – pair it with your jeans and suede jacket and you’ve nailed the look without a hint of froth or floral. It’s another wardrobe stalwart which means it’s worth investing in decent quality so that you don’t end up with synthetic lace. Be careful with anything high or round-necked because you can easily end up looking more like a prim Victorian matron than the Boho gypsy you’re aiming for, especially if you have a generous bosom – it’s always better to go for something with a button front so that you can adjust the V to fit your bust.
This is organic cotton guipure lace…

This one factors in this season’s polka dot craze so you’re hitting two trends for the price of one (the pearl button at the neck can be left undone)

Polka dot tulle blouse
Such a lovely broderie neckline on this one…

Organic cotton blouse
Simpler here and in the sale if you’re quick

Organic cotton – in the sale
They’re still either flared or wide legged and high waisted, it makes sense with the whole 70s vibe that comes with Boho. My favourite patch pocket pair are in the sale now – they’re very similar to the constantly sold out M&S ones but better quality in a heavier denim.

Patch pocket jeans
For added 70s drama you want these – they’re quite generous and stretchy so size down.

Flared jeans
You’ll notice that ‘baby tees’ are everywhere all of a sudden – they’re longer than a cropped t-shirt but they sit at the top of the waistband so that you don’t have to tuck them in. They’re designed to be worn with high waisted flares but before you discount them they’re also really good for pairing with skirts… and skirts are pushing dresses into the curb. These are the best value I’ve found (various colours available).

Baby tee
And they come in a stripe too.

Stripe baby tee
If you have more budget this has a tactile finish because it’s a hemp blend.

Or there are merino/cashmere options in various colours.

Merino/cashmere baby tee
Ah now shoes are a subject for 2025 because they’re coming back across the board. After lockdown fashion editors declared that the trainer would rule and the shoe was dead forever… but fashion is fickle and now, of course, it’s leaning back towards a more elegant foot. It’s something I really noticed amongst millennials and Gen Z when I was in London last week. For the last few years I’ve made a point of sitting with a coffee and seeing how many women wearing shoes I could spot in the space of two minutes. The ratio has been 90:10 in favour of trainers for a very long time but last week it was 50:50 which is a dramatic turn.
So what are people wearing? Loafers are very popular worn with a cool sock, it was too early in the season for sandals so otherwise it was all about ballet flats and slingbacks. Because of the wide proportion of the jeans, most looks style Boho 2025 with ballet flats. They can be the simple, traditional style and I’m going to add some here with arch support because I’m so often asked for them.

Ballet flats with proper foot support(lots of colours available)
Alternatively you can opt for the new ‘teacher style’ ballet flat with a tie bow although they’ve almost sold out in a week…

Teacher style ballet flat
… or Mary Janes (for an arch support alternativelook here)

Gold Mary Janes
You can still wear trainers with Boho but they need proper discussion so keep on reading and you’ll find that further down.
For AW24 we saw the return of rich brown shades as a key alternative to black or navy – they looked fabulous paired with rich reds, cobalt blues and other colours. Now, for summer, they’re paling to mocha mousse which was Pantone’s colour of the year. So you’re going to see shades of milky coffee, pale tan and khaki everywhere. The new M&S drop last week was completely dominated by it (round-up here)

I was a big fan of brown last season because it’s rich, especially in winter textures of cashmere and wool. I’m going to sound a warning over mocha mousse because although it instantly makes you think of chic Milanese culture, that doesn’t translate as easily to a British summer. As with all colours it depends on your skintone. When you imagine your stylish woman in Milan, she has natural high contrast with her olive skin, dark eyebrows and shiny brown hair. She’s in an environment that’s drenched in sunshine surrounded by great architecture and glossy green conifers so all of the sand shades work in harmony. If you have more subdued contrast levels of pigmentation like me that have been knocked back even more post menopause, mocha mousse is basically going to be beige… and set against English landscapes you’ll be more of a wren than a peacock. So if you like it perhaps use it as a neutral with a stronger colour to add depth – and as I’m not a fan, that’s where I’m leaving the trend for mocha mousse.

In my opinion this trend is the gift of SS25 – think nautical style in the time of Coco Chanel. So it isn’t the coastal grandmother trend (below) that was around about three years ago which was very relaxed, based around creased linen trousers with an oversized breton or a chambray shirt and basket look.

2022’s coastal grandmother look
Nor is it the Seasalt outdoorsy look of a stripey top in knocked back colours with dropped shoulders. It’s sharp and detailed – marine worn the way that Audrey Hepburn would style it or Jackie Kennedy or Kate Middleton, co-ordinated and crisp… often with a red accent.

This is the look that the brands know will be loved by everyone, regardless of age and they’ve bought into it big time, it’s everywhere.

Notice that there are a lot of Chanel style tricot pieces (at surprisingly good prices – and yes, by coincidence or osmosis I was wearing a navy and white striped sweatshirt)…

Trimmed polo top
… everything is a neat fit…

… shoulders are sharp, the look is crisp and detailed.

Paris tee(also available in plain cream with scarlet text)
This is the easiest route to a wardrobe update for SS25. When you’re going through what you already have, make sure that everything looks fresh, this isn’t the year for a washed out look. Stripes are mostly deep navy with ecru, the contrast colour can be bright red or a deeper burgundy; edging and trim-detailing is key.
In terms of bottoms think preppy. So you can go for wide leg trousers with sailor detailing as in the Kate Middleton photo above. Or look for patch pocket jeans in a deep indigo – these are my highly recommended if you can get hold of a pair (they’re restocked regularly but they sell out straightaway).

Indigo patch pocket jeans
Here’s an alternative

Indigo pocket jeans
Or a smart tailored pair here.

Tailored jeans
Alternatively you could wear a more tapered 7/8 crop jean or cotton trouser with this look – but make it indigo… or cream as we move towards the better weather.
As for accessories this isn’t the year for a straw basket (unless you’re on holiday), think red leather crossbody or phone case… although your tan suede Boho bag can work with this too. Shoes – ballet flats are great, especially in red leather… boat shoes are trending but they could render the look a bit too literal… and this is the place for Mary-Janes with a low block heel or slingbacks. Here are a few ways of building a capsule

Top to bottom, L-R
If Boho’s a rejection of the status quo you may be thinking that Marine is the polar opposite but it isn’t really. A need to look smart with a neat outline is often a response to global agitation, it helps people to feel in control – just think back to 1940s style for example. And so actually the new Boho and Marine are sisters – see how well marine harmonises with these touches of Boho that we discussed earlier. There are lots of easy, ageless ways to be on trend this season.

L-R, top to bottom
So, Boho and Marine are, my friends, the simplest way of updating your look for 2025, an easy way to show that you’re still aware of the zeitgeist. What other little gems have I gleaned from trawling through what has probably been the most fragmented season on the catwalks for a long time?
Well, there’s the return of the skirt as I mentioned – the dress is out in the shade and midi-skirts are back, in particular the pleated skirt which only seems to have been ‘resting’ since 2016. You’ll also see the puffball skirt around, M&S have this gorgeous raspberry red version arriving in April but I can’t get the the ironing conundrum out of my head.

Peep toe shoes are another thing, you know the 1940s style.

Sports utility is a small slice of the SS25 forecast but it’s very strong in outerwear. You’re going to see lots of anoraks everywhere – yes really, anoraks.

Rainproof anorak
And the utility jacket that dropped at M&S last Thursday has already sold out although returns are starting to trickle in if you love it. It’s all over Instagram but bear in mind that it’s very oversized, I looked ridiculous when I tried it in store.

Utility jacket
This is in a softer lyocell fabric so it will sit better if you love the style.

Or this one would work as a hybrid between the utility and marine trends with its lovely clean lines.

Clean cotton jacket
The colours you’re going to see around are unusual. Butter yellow and sugar mouse pink are big right now, pastels always are in the earliest months of spring. Coming through is mocha mousse of course but also sky blue with extra points for pairing it with burgundy, West Ham football strip style. Grass green and tomato red are as strong as they have been for the last few seasons and once again, the key metallic is silver.
Trainers, the ever evolving staple that the youth use to stay ahead of GenX. You already know that the pure white trainer is over, this is the year that you’ll come to accept it – particularly the white Vega… what goes so very high up must come down. So when coloured trainers are in, it really does mean that you have to think about your accent shades for the season.
I hear that Adidas is still acceptable for midlifers to wear – not so cool for millennials or zoomers but we can carry on. So you need to decide on your style, I prefer Spezials and Gazelles to the Samba because I find them more comfortable – the toe box isn’t as narrow. If you want to be slightly more on trend though look at the Tokyos. They have this season’s low profile which makes them work well with a dress or shorts because they aren’t as chunky on the leg.

Adidas Tokyo, 5 other colours available
Next up is another low profile trainer, the Onitsuka Tiger, still trending with lots of new colourways for SS25. They’re expensive but the leather is butter soft and so comfortable.

Onitsuka trainer
And riding high is the Speedcat which you’ll see being copied by lots of high street brands including Hush and Cos. I never understand why anybody would buy a copy rather than the original though, especially as they cost more or less the same. These are the ones I’m adding to my collection for this year because I know I’ll be wearing a lot of navy with red accents…

Speedcats
– there are lots of other colours available though, some of them really fabulous, look at these for example.

Speedcats
I went to buy mine last weekend but was then distracted by the summer version – it isn’t often you find trainers designed for warmer weather (also available in black).

Speedcat Go
So I hope that’s helped you to find a few wearable trends for midlifers SS25. As I said at the beginning, it’s really just about wardrobe adjustment rather than starting afresh every season these days. I’ll be back next week with a try-on, in the meantime I’ll soon be sending an email out to everyone who expressed interest in the salsa trip to Colombia next September (2026). It will include an invitation to our Zoom meeting on8th April at 7pm BST (GMT+1). American friends can you let me know beforehand if that’s a problem for you and what might work better – we can always do two if we have to. It will give you a chance to talk to us and David and ask any questions you might have. We have a lovely mixed bunch of couples and solos interested so if we can get enough people to commit to the trip (we need a minimum of ten travellers) we could have a great time. If you haven’t put your name down and would like to join the chat to find more about a week of salsa immersion add your email address here.
